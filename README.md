There are four(4) different assignments in this repository.
The reason being that I couldn't create a succesful host after this one.
I got it figured out when the task submission has elapsed.
Below is the list of assignments in this repo:

(1) FLEX-BOX LAYOUT(https://sawlew.github.io/)
(2) GRID LAYOUT(https://sawlew.github.io/grid.html)
(3) RESPONSIVENESS AND MEDIA QUERIES 1(https://sawlew.github.io/rmq.html)
(4) RESPONSIVENESS AND MEDIA QUERIES 2(https://sawlew.github.io/huddle.html)
